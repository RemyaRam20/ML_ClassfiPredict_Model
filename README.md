# Offensive Language Detection (Machine-Learning) Supervised Classfication and Prediction Model

The purpose of our project was to develop a supervised machine learning classification model that can be used to predict if a tweet is offensive.
More specifically, the model will classify the tweet into one of three categories: Not Offensive (NOT), Targeted Insult (TIN), or Untargeted (UNT). 
To teach the model, we were given a set of 10,592 annotated tweets to be used for training and validation. 
The ultimate goal of our project was to develop a high-performance model through clever feature selection and the choice of optimal parameters.
This was done through a methodical process that involved the use of many python packages, data preprocessing techniques, trial and error and experimentation.
